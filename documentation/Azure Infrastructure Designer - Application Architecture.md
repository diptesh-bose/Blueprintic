# Blueprintic - Application Architecture

## Overview

Blueprintic is a GenAI-powered web application that enables users to architect, design, and implement Azure infrastructure services through a drag-and-drop interface. It helps you move from envisioning and drawing architecture to generating infrastructure as code. The application processes natural language prompts to generate infrastructure blueprints, which users can then customize and export as deployment templates.

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend (React TypeScript)

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, providing a modern, responsive user interface with the following key components:

- **Canvas Component**: A drag-and-drop interface where users can visualize and modify Azure infrastructure components.
- **Component Library**: A collection of Azure service components that users can drag onto the canvas.
- **Prompt Interface**: A text input area where users can describe their infrastructure needs in natural language.
- **Project Management**: UI for saving, loading, and managing infrastructure projects.
- **Template Export**: Functionality to export the designed infrastructure as ARM templates or Terraform configurations.

### 2. Backend (Flask)

The backend is built with Flask and provides the following services:

- **Project Storage**: Database for storing user projects and infrastructure designs.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization services.
- **GenAI Integration**: API endpoints for processing natural language prompts and generating infrastructure blueprints.
- **Template Generation**: Services for converting visual designs into deployable Azure templates.

### 3. GenAI Agent

The GenAI agent is responsible for:

- **Prompt Analysis**: Understanding user requirements from natural language descriptions.
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Determining the appropriate Azure services and their relationships.
- **Blueprint Generation**: Creating a structured representation of the infrastructure design.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommending improvements to the infrastructure design.

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User provides a natural language prompt describing their infrastructure needs.
2. **Prompt Processing**: The GenAI agent processes the prompt and generates an infrastructure blueprint.
3. **Visual Representation**: The blueprint is rendered on the canvas as a collection of Azure service components.
4. **User Customization**: User can modify the design by adding, removing, or reconfiguring components.
5. **Template Generation**: The final design is converted into deployable Azure templates.
6. **Project Storage**: User can save the project for future reference or modification.

## API Contracts

### Frontend to Backend

```typescript
// Project Management
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  components: AzureComponent[];
  connections: Connection[];
}

// Azure Component
interface AzureComponent {
  id: string;
  type: string; // e.g., "VirtualMachine", "StorageAccount"
  name: string;
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  position: { x: number, y: number };
}

// Component Connection
interface Connection {
  id: string;
  sourceId: string;
  targetId: string;
  type: string; // e.g., "NetworkConnection", "DependsOn"
  properties: Record<string, any>;
}

// API Endpoints
// GET /api/projects - List all projects
// GET /api/projects/:id - Get a specific project
// POST /api/projects - Create a new project
// PUT /api/projects/:id - Update a project
// DELETE /api/projects/:id - Delete a project

// POST /api/generate - Generate infrastructure from prompt
// POST /api/export/:id - Export project as ARM template or Terraform
```

### GenAI Integration

```typescript
// Prompt Processing
interface PromptRequest {
  prompt: string;
  constraints?: {
    budget?: number;
    region?: string;
    compliance?: string[];
  };
}

interface PromptResponse {
  components: AzureComponent[];
  connections: Connection[];
  recommendations: Recommendation[];
}

interface Recommendation {
  type: string; // e.g., "Performance", "Cost", "Security"
  description: string;
  impact: "High" | "Medium" | "Low";
}

// API Endpoint
// POST /api/genai/process - Process a natural language prompt
```

## Azure Service Component Library

The application will support the following Azure services initially:

1. **Compute**
   - Virtual Machines
   - App Services
   - Azure Functions
   - Azure Kubernetes Service

2. **Storage**
   - Blob Storage
   - File Storage
   - Table Storage
   - Queue Storage

3. **Networking**
   - Virtual Networks
   - Subnets
   - Network Security Groups
   - Load Balancers

4. **Databases**
   - Azure SQL
   - Cosmos DB
   - MySQL
   - PostgreSQL

5. **Security**
   - Key Vault
   - Azure Active Directory
   - Role-Based Access Control

6. **Integration**
   - Logic Apps
   - API Management
   - Event Grid
   - Service Bus

Each component will have a visual representation, configurable properties, and connection points for linking with other components.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Canvas Implementation

The drag-and-drop canvas will be implemented using React Flow or a similar library, providing:

- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Component connections with visual links
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Grid alignment
- Component property editing

### GenAI Integration

The GenAI agent will be implemented using:

- OpenAI API or similar LLM service for natural language processing
- Custom prompt engineering for Azure infrastructure design
- Structured output format for consistent blueprint generation
- Feedback loop for improving recommendations based on user modifications

### Template Generation

The application will generate:

- ARM templates (JSON)
- Terraform configurations (HCL)
- Azure CLI scripts
- PowerShell scripts

### Deployment Considerations

- Frontend will be deployed as a static site
- Backend will be deployed as a Flask application
- Database will use MySQL for project storage
- Authentication will leverage OAuth providers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Collaborative Editing**: Allow multiple users to work on the same infrastructure design.
2. **Cost Estimation**: Provide real-time cost estimates for the designed infrastructure.
3. **Compliance Checking**: Validate designs against compliance frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS).
4. **Infrastructure as Code Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub repositories for CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Monitoring Configuration**: Add monitoring and alerting configuration to the infrastructure design.
